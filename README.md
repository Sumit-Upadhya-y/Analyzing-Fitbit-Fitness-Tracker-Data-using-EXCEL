Data Source
The data used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, provided by MÃ¶bius. The dataset contains minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring data from Fitbit users. This data was collected via a distributed survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 from 30 eligible Fitbit users.

Tasks and Findings

# Task 1: Identifying Potential Customers for Leanfit
Objective: Identify potential customers for Leanfit, a subsidiary of WeFit that sells personalized diet plans.

Method:
Analyzed users' Body Mass Index (BMI), activity levels, and heart rate data.
Focused on users within the overweight (BMI 25-30) and obesity (BMI >30) ranges who are likely to benefit from weight loss plans.
Findings: Customers with higher BMI and elevated heart rates during activities were identified as potential buyers for Leanfit's personalized diet plans.

# Task 2: Identifying Potential Customers for FitWear
Objective: Identify potential customers for FitWear, a subsidiary of WeFit that sells fitness gear.

Method:
Analyzed users' daily activity data, focusing on those recording high levels of active minutes (both very active and fairly active minutes).
Identified users who consistently wear their fitness gear and engage in high levels of physical activity.
Findings: Customers who frequently recorded high active minutes and demonstrated consistent usage of fitness gear were identified as potential buyers for FitWear's products.

# Task 3: Identifying Potential Customers for Sleepy-Nights
Objective: Identify potential customers for Sleepy-Nights, a subsidiary of WeFit that offers a sleep scheduling app.

Method:
Analyzed users' sleep patterns, focusing on those with irregular sleep schedules and symptoms of sleep deprivation (e.g., excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating).
Identified users who could benefit from improved sleep hygiene and scheduling.
Findings: Customers with inconsistent sleep patterns and insufficient sleep duration were identified as potential subscribers for Sleepy-Nights' sleep scheduling app.

# Task 4: Creating a Dashboard
Objective: Develop a dashboard to present key insights and visualizations of the Fitbit data for WeFit's management team.

Method:
Analyzed daily activity data to identify unique users and their usage patterns.
Categorized users into groups based on activity levels (Active, Moderate, Light) and fitness levels (Pro, Intermediate, Beginner) based on distance traveled.
Created visualizations showing user activity trends, including steps taken, calories burned, and active minutes.
Findings: The dashboard provides a clear and comprehensive visualization of user activity trends, helping WeFit's management team make data-driven decisions.
